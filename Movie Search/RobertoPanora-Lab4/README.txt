Extra Credit: Context Menu fully functional to add movie to favorites, Studio 3 submitted

Creative Portion:

I have a save button which then leads to my two creative portions:


1) Upon the initial load into the app, the user is presented a list of popular movies by default that they can interact with and explore before searching. This allows for a much more interactive experience in the beginning of the app. This was in the piazza post: Showing new movies or popular movies when the app launches that would earn credit.


2) Through my connection to SQLite, I stored the image as a data string so that when you click your favorites in the table you can still get the movie information page when you are offline. This was mentioned in the piazza post: Saving all the information about a favorite movie locally (so that you can click on the favorite and see the movie detail page, even without internet connection).
